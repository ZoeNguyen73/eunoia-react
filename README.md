## About my process

### Challenges
* Learning how to use Django Rest Framework was definitely the biggest challenge that I had. Things become a lot less apparent as I utilise in-built functions and views, which in turn makes a steep learning curving and lengthens bug-fixing process significantly
* Some of the logic that I planned for turned out to be too complicated to implement in Front-End, especially given shortage of time. I had to forgo a few features, such as: allowing multiple timeslots selection per listing, letting donors select recipients, etc
